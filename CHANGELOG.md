# Changelog

All notable changes to tether are recorded here. CI promotes `[Unreleased]` to a
version section on release.

## [Unreleased]

- Added `tmux::Session`, the pure tmux control client: startup and client size,
  reply matching with the in-flight cap, pausing panes nobody watches, snapshots that
  are retried when a tmux hook tears or changes the pane mid-list, gaps, layouts, cwd
  subscriptions, and typed commands for locate, votes, history, input and paste (a
  failed paste leaves nothing in tmux's buffers). Tested against recorded tmux 3.4
  streams.
- Added the snapshot restore-byte composer (`tmux::snapshot::compose`): bytes that
  rebuild a pane's screen (primary and alternate), cursor, modes, scroll region and
  tab stops in a freshly reset terminal, so clients carry no restore logic.
  `Event::Snapshot` now carries the pane size and these bytes. Checked against
  `vt100` and tmux's own capture on recorded styled, scroll-region and
  alternate-screen panes.
- Added the tmux bridge's I/O: the control-client pump (`tmux::pump`), which moves
  bytes between a `tmux -C` process and the hub and closes it on request, and one-shot
  commands (`tmux::oneshot`) for the session listing, Locate, and new windows and
  sessions, with a 2 s timeout and a "no server" answer. Every invocation passes `-N`
  (never starts a server) and `-u` (names and paths stay UTF-8 whatever the locale).
  Tested against a real tmux with `TETHER_TMUX_TESTS=1`.
- Added the wire protocol (`proto`): the JSON messages, binary frames, version range
  and close codes, with the web's TypeScript types generated into
  `web/proto/generated/` and checked for staleness by `cargo test`.
- Added the hub: the daemon's core that turns the phone's watches into tmux work. It
  finds each watched window's session and attaches one control client per session,
  follows windows that move between sessions, catches a tab up by snapshot on open,
  resize, pane change or overflow, and reports closed windows, sessions and servers.
  A detached control client ends its tabs; a crashed one is restarted once. Every byte
  to a connection is bounded by its credit, so a slow phone starves only its own tab,
  which catches up by snapshot.
- The control-client pump reads tmux's output in batches: a pane flooding short lines
  costs the daemon about 2% of a core instead of 47%. Typing echo is unchanged when
  idle, and up to about 3 ms later while a pane floods.
- A history request whose rows exceed tmux's 1 MiB reply cap is retried by the hub
  with half the rows, down to one row, so the client gets a shorter `historyChunk`
  instead of an error and asks again from where it ends.
